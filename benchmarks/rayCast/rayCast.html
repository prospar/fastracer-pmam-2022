<h2>Sparse-Triangle Intersection (RAY):</h2> 

Given a set of triangles contained inside a 3d bounding box and a set
of rays that penetrate the box, calculate for each ray the first
triangle it intersects.

<h3>Input and Output File Formats</h3>

<p>
The input consists of two files.  The first file is a sequence of
triangles in the <a href="benchmarks/geometryIO.html">triangle</a>
file format.  The triangles need have 3 dimensional coordinates.  The
second file is a sequence of 3 dimensional rays in the <a
href="benchmarks/geometryIO.html">ray</a> file format.  The source of
each ray needs to be outside the axis align bounding box for the
triangles.
The output needs to be in the <a
href="benchmarks/sequenceIO.html">sequence</a> file format and must
contain for each input ray the integer index of the first triangle
it intersects (0 based).
</p>

<h3>Default Input Distributions</h3>

This benchmark is run on three meshes, which are distributed as part
of the benchmark.  In all cases a set of random rays coming from one
side of the bounding box are generated using
<blockquote>
<tt>addRays &lt;triangelFile&gt; &lt;raylFile&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
This generates a number of rays equal to the number of triangles.
All three inputs are weighted equally.  The input
files are:

<ul>
<li>
(1) Happy.  This input is the famous "happy Buddha" mesh from the <a
href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/">Stanford 3D
Scanning Repository</a> .  It consists of 1087716 triangles.

<li>
(1) Angel. This input is from Georgia Teach and consists of 474048 triangles.

<li>
(1) Dragon.   
This input is also from the
the <a
href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/">Stanford 3D
Scanning Repository</a>.  It consists of 871414 triangles.
</ul>

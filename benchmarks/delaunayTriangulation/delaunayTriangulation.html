<h2>Delaunay Triangulation (DT):</h2> 

<p>
Given a set of points in 2 dimensions generate the Delaunay triangulation.
</p>

<h3>Input and Output File Formats</h3>

<p>
The input needs to be in the <a href="benchmarks/geometryIO.html">2d
points</a> file format and the output needs to be in the <a
href="benchmarks/geometryIO.html">triangle</a> format.  Triangles can
be in any order but the coordinates need to be in the same order in
the output as in the input.  The output can include additional points
beyond the original points.  These extra points must appear in the
output after the original points and the resulting triangles must be a
Delaunay triangulation of all points.  The extra points can be used,
for example, to insert points at the corners of a bounding box around
the original points.
</p>

<h3>Default Input Distributions</h3>

Each distribution should be run for <tt>n=10,000,000</tt>.  The point
sets should have no degeneracies and standard geometric predicates
(e.g., line side and in circle) should be resolvable with double
precision floating point arithmetic.  The purpose of this benchmark is
not to compare state-of-the-art exact geometric predicates.
The two tests are given equal weight.
<ul>
<li>
(1) Points selected at random uniformly within a unit circle.
<blockquote>
<tt>uniform -s -d 2 &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
(1) Points selected at random from the Kuzmin distribution.  This is a 2d
version of the 3d Plummer distribution with points highly concentrated around the origin,
but some points far off.
<blockquote>
<tt>plummer -d 2 &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
